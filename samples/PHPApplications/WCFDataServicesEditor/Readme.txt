Setup Instructions
==================
 1. Before you can use this application, you must complete the OData SDK for PHP setup as explained in the User Guide document in \docs or framewrok\readme.txt directory.

 2. This application consumes NorthWindDataServices, for hosting this service see /WCFDataServices/readme.txt
       
 2. The WCFDataServiceEditor (Common\WCFDataServiceEditor.php) can be used to add/edit/delete entities exposed by any WCF Data Service. The application uses
    the proxy class generated by the PhpDataSvcUtil to connect to an NorthWind Data Service and allow the user to perform basic operations
    such as browsing, adding, editing, deleting records.The directory already contains the proxy class for an NorthWind Data Service that exposes
    the NorthWind Database.
 
 4. Check the index.php file under the \samples\WCFDataServicesEditor and verify that the NORTHWIND_SERVICE_URL constant is defined
    with the correct URL of the NorthWind Data Service deployed with the Visual Studio project, the default value is
    define("NORTHWIND_SERVICE_URL", "http://localhost:13985/NorthwindDataService.svc");
	
 5. Deploy the WCFDataServiceEditor to a Web server and navigate to the index.php page

       
 
 Note
 ==== 
 The WCFDataServicesEditor can be used to edit any data service by changing the proxy class that is included in the Index.php file.
 To connect to a generic WCF Data Service:
  
1. generate the proxy class for the data service using the PHPDataSvcUtil (let's assume the new proxy class filename is any_proxy.php)

2. In the Index.php file under the samples\PHPApplications\WCFDataServicesEditor
     Replace
        - require_once 'NorthwindEntities.php';
     with
        - require_once 'any_proxy.php';

     Replace 
        - $editor = new WCFDataServicesEditor("./index.php", "NorthwindEntities", NORTHWIND_SERVICE_URL);
     with
        - $editor = new WCFDataServicesEditor("./index.php", 'any_proxy_container_class_name', DEFAULT_URI_GENERATED_IN_any_proxy.php_FILE);

3. You can also specify the number of records that is to be displayed in a page, for this:
        - $editor = new WCFDataServicesEditor("./index.php", 'any_proxy_container_class_name', DEFAULT_URI_GENERATED_IN_any_proxy.php_FILE, true /*enable paging*/, 5 /*page size*/);

4. If needed, HTTP Proxy details can be passed to the WCFDataServicesEditor as follows,
      $editor = new WCFDataServicesEditor("./index.php", "NorthwindEntities", NORTHWIND_SERVICE_URL, "webproxy.mydomain.com", 8080);
      
5. If you use another filename (say myfile.php) instead of index.php, pass this filename as first argument as follows,
      $editor = new WCFDataServicesEditor("./myfile.php", "NorthwindEntities", NORTHWIND_SERVICE_URL);
